## Overview
This project implements a simple web application for sentiment analysis using a deep learning model. Users can enter a text review, and the model will predict whether the sentiment is positive or negative.

## Files and Directories
- `sentiment_analysis_model.h5`: The trained sentiment analysis model's weights and architecture.
- `tokenizer.pickle`: Serialized tokenizer used for text preprocessing.
- `app.py`: The main Streamlit web application script.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for your project.
- `Techdome_solution_assignment.ipynb`: Jypyter Notebook script for data prorcessing, model building and training.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sarthak-1408/Techdome-solution-assignment
   cd Techdome-solution-assignment
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

## Model Training
If you need to retrain the model, refer to the training script and data in your Jupyter notebook or Python script. Update the model file and tokenizer accordingly.
